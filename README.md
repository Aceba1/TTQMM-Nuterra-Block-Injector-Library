### C# Mod Blocks
For making blocks with a TTMM mod, take a look at the [`BlockExamples.cs`](https://github.com/Aceba1/TTQMM-Nuterra-Block-Injector-Library/blob/master/Nuterra.BlockInjector/BlockExamples.cs) for demonstration.

(Additionally, you can check out other repos in use of this library mod)

### JSON File Blocks
To make blocks:
- Take a look at the [`Example.json`](https://github.com/Aceba1/TTQMM-Nuterra-Block-Injector-Library/blob/master/Nuterra.BlockInjector/Block%20Example.json) file.
- Copy and paste this into your `Custom Blocks` folder, within the game's installation path
- You can find a collection of blocks / examples this [forum page](https://forum.terratechgame.com/index.php?threads/custom-blocks.17452/)
