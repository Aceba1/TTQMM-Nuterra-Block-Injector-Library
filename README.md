# TTQMM-Nuterra-BlockInjector
Grab the `Nuterra.BlockInjector` folder from [here](https://github.com/Aceba1/TTQMM-Nuterra-Block-Injector-Library/tree/master/Nuterra.BlockInjector/bin/Debug), and put it in the QMods folder in your TerraTech install path.

<hr>

QMM can be found [here](https://github.com/QModManager/TerraTech).

Use the the Setup program in the Installer folder, or copy the Installer folder's contents to your game's install path (for Steam users, it is somthing like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TerraTech Beta`),  go to `TerraTech*_Data\Managed` and run the Manager executable. Whenever the game updates, just run that executable again.
