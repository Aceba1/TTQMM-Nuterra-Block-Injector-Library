# TTQMM-Nuterra-BlockInjector
Load custom blocks right in to TerraTech!

## Creating your own
A file named `Example.json` can be found in the new Custom Blocks folder at the root of TT. Make a copy of that and change its values to your new desired block. Add files such as images and meshes to bring it to life!

Better explained guidance can be found on the TerraTech Forum or Discord

**You can use the [TerraTech Mod Manager](https://github.com/Aceba1/TerraTech-Mod-Manager) to use this mod, or set it manually with QMM.**

QMM can be found [here](https://github.com/QModManager/TerraTech).

Use the the Setup program in the Installer folder, or copy the Installer folder's contents to your game's install path (for Steam users, it is somthing like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TerraTech Beta`),  go to `TerraTech*_Data\Managed` and run the Manager executable. Whenever the game updates, just run that executable again.
